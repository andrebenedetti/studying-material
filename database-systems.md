# Intro

If you know nothing about databases, I highly recommend watching [DBMS by Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-k-h0GuFmE&list=PL9ysvtVnryGpnIj9rcIqNDxakUn6v72Hm). This will provide you all the information you need to start working with database systems and take your first steps with relational databases.

Going further, [Introduction to NoSQL • Martin Fowler • GOTO 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I) provides a valuable vision of the history of non relational databases which leads to understanding use cases that may be a good fit
